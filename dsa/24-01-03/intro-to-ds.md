The structure to represent data.
DS is an organized collection of data.

DS is categorized into two types:
- Linear
- Non-linear

Linear DS:
- Direct Access -> Homogeneous (array) and heterogeneous(record)
- Sequential Access -> general (list) and lifo (stack)

Non-linear DS: They are not ordered, like a tree or a graph.
homo: all elements are of the same type.
hetero: contains different or same elements.

static and dynamic memory allocation:
static: array
dynamic: list using pointers

Every data that is stored in a computer is kept in a memory cell with a specific address.

Operations on DS: Creating, inserting, modifying, traversing, searching, deleting, sorting, merging, copying, concatenating, splitting.

Q. Give example of different DS.

Q. Applications of DS.
