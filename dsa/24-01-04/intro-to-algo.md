# Intro to Algorithms

#### Algorithm Definition

It is a step by step instruction that allows (us or) a computer to solve a problem.
Execution of the step. It must cover each and every details of the problem statement. It should be unambiguous.
Should be one after another which means it is sequential.

It takes set of values as input and produces results as the output.

It should be independent of any syntax of any programming language. It should be generic enough for the dev to allow him/her to implement
it in any programming language he/she wants.

Algorithms are followed in day to day life. We are always executing a sets of statements like making tea.

Q: Write an algorithm to add two numbers entered by the user?

1. Start
2. Declare n1, n2, sum
3. Read n1, n2
4. sum = n1 + n2
5. Display sum
6. Stop

##### Conditional

Q: Write an algorithm to check whether a number is positive or negative.

1. Start
2. Declare num
3. Read num
4. if num is greater or equal to zero then
   1. Display "Number entered is positive"
   2. else Display "Number entered is negative"
5. Stop

or

1. Start
2. Declare num
3. Read num
4. if num is greater or equal to zero then
   1. Display "Number entered is positive"
5. Otherwise
   1. Display "Number entered is negative"
6. Stop

### Loops

Q: Write an algorithm to find the factorial of a number

1. Start
2. Declare num, fac, count
3. Read num
4. fac = 1, i = 1
5. If num is equal to zero then
   1. Print 1
   2. Stop
6. fac = fac \* num
7. i = i + 1
8. Repeat step 6 to 7 until i is equal to num
9. Print fac
10. Stop

or

1. Start
2. Declare variables num, fac, count
3. Read variables num
4. fac = 1, i = 1
5. If num is equal to zero then
   1. Print 1
   2. Stop
6. Repeat until i is equal to num
   1. fac = fac \* num
   2. i = i + 1
7. Print fac
8. Stop

An algorithm should be easy to understand, concise, efficient.
