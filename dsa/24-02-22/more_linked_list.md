# List traversal

**Write an algorithm to traversing the list.**

1. Start
2. Declare runner
3. Initialize runner = head
4. repeat until runner != NULL
    1. print runner->data
    2. runner = runner->next
5. Stop

**Write an algorithm to find the location LOC of the node where ITEM first appears in the list, or sets LOC = NULL if search is unsuccessful.**

1. Start
2. Declare PTR
3. Initialize PTR = head
4. repeat until PTR != NULL
    1. if ITEM == PTR->
        1. LOC = PTR
        2. return
    2. else
        1. PTR = PTR->next
5. LOC = NULL
6. Stop
